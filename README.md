# N-Puzzle-Problem
N Puzzle Problem (A* algorithm), uses two heuristic function.
Heuristic 1: Manhatten Distance,
Heuristic 2: Number of moves done from initial state to obtain current state.

This project uses A* algorithm to solve N Puzzle Problem.
N Puzzle Problem consist of a initial state of N element represented in the form of a matrix of size N in a unordered way.
Algorithm will make the changes to the puzzle in series of steps using A* algorithm and will find the solution if possible.

Inputs: 
1.	N: no of elements in puzzle
2.	Initial matrix of unordered elements
3.	Goal matrix in which the puzzle is to be solved

Output:
	The program will show all the intermediate state and the Cost of each state.
  At the end of the program execution, the Final state of goal state will b displayed.
               
Running the code:
	Enclosed is a java project which can be imported to an IDE or view the java code directly from 
	the src folder of the project.
